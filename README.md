# About
Project Games API  is a free REST API intended for web development students who want to connect to an API for coding projects. 

The database provides various resources for game creation, including a deck of playing cards, a deck of tarot cards, coins, dice, and sets of words.

I decided to work on this side project as a way to learn more about how APIs work. I took a course on Udemy on how to create a REST API with object-oriented PHP. 
Then I used what I learned to modify that code for this project.
